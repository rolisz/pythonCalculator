Simple calculator application made in Python so that I could learn the basics of tokenizing, parsing and interpreting.
The calculator can do the basic arithmetic operations (+,-,*/,%,^) and calculate sin, cos, ln, lgamma and erfc. You can also use variables in it.
Simplest way to use it is to run the repl.py, which is a REPL for the calculator.
